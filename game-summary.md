# Game Summary
a summary of how the game should function, in sequential order

## Upon opening the app
- End user is prompted with starting page which prompts for difficulty settings and has a start button to start the game

## After Start button is clicked
- a countdown screen is intiated to prep end user for start of game
- when countdown is complete, the end user will be flashed the hidden numbers for a brief moment, not long enough to easily memorize all the locations of the hidden numbers and their pairs
- after the hidden numbers are flashed, the numbers are then hidden and the game timer will begin to start and at this point regular game play will ensue

## If end user makes all of the matches before the time runs out
- The end user will be alerted that they have won the round/game
- end user will have the option to play again or go back to starting page (where they can choose difficulty and also choose to play again)

## If timer reaches 0:00 before the end user finds all the matches
- The end user will be alerted that they have lost the round/game
- end user will have the option to play again or go back to starting page (where they can choose difficulty and also choose to play again)
