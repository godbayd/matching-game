## Current 
- [x] make a scss-modules branch in git [check]
- [x] break the scss down into modular components
- [x] merge with starting-page and continue with starting page

# To do
- [x] create timer state in gameState and add a duration property so that the timer can be configured dynamically 
- Build Settings page
  - Build html start page where settings can be configured before start of game
  - start page will ask for difficulty level
  - add difficulty level state to gameState
  - start page will have begin button that will replace the temp start timer in the .timer-container element used for testing. 
  - when begin button is clicked, the start page will leave and the game board will enter. 
  - when the game board enters, it will flash all of the numbers very briefly and then hide them and start the timer. 

## keep in mind for down the road
- game loop
