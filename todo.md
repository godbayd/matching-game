# To Do
- [ ] clean up code
    - clean up(refactor) file then remove unused imports
    - organize files, combine files that don't need to be separate
        - [ ] win-loss-alert.js and populateHiddenNumberCons.js is too small, their code can be integrated elsewhere
        - [ ] updateHtml.js might not need to be its own module, its contents might be better integrated elsewhere
        - [x] in updateHtml.js, show/hideElem functions are deprecated and should be removed. Make sure they arent implemented anywhere
    - improve aliases
- [ ] make responsive
- [ ] fine tune animation
- [ ] figure out deployment
- [ ] deploy :)

## done
- [x] click listeners should only listen when animations are complete.
